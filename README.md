Calculator Tutorial
Welcome to the Calculator Tutorial repository! This project is designed as an educational tool to help beginners understand the basics of using Python for simple mathematical operations and to introduce the essentials of using Git for version control.

About This Repository
In this repository, we explore how to create a simple calculator class in Python that can perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The code serves as a practical example to demonstrate the following:

Methods in Python: Each arithmetic operation is implemented as a method within the calculator class, showcasing how methods can be defined and used in Python.
Using Git for Version Control: This project also serves as a guide to managing your code with Git. You will find practical examples of how to push and pull code to and from GitHub, helping you manage and share your code effectively.

Calculator Class
The calculator class is defined with the following methods:

add(x, y): Returns the sum of x and y.
subtract(x, y): Returns the difference between x and y.
multiply(x, y): Returns the product of x and y.
divide(x, y): Returns the quotient of x and y.

Example Usage
python
Copy code
calc = calculator()
print(calc.add(5, 3))       # Output: 8
print(calc.subtract(5, 3))  # Output: 2
print(calc.multiply(5, 3))  # Output: 15
print(calc.divide(5, 3))    # Output: 1.666...
Getting Started with Git
To get the most out of this project, you'll want to familiarize yourself with basic Git commands such as git clone, git add, git commit, git push, and git pull. Each of these commands is integral to sharing and updating your work, as demonstrated in this tutorial.

Feel free to explore the repository, try out the code, and dive into the world of Python programming and version control with me!
